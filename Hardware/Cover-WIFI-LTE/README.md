# Enhanced Antenna Cover for uConsole CM4

## Overview
This repository contains the design files for an enhanced antenna cover for the uConsole CM4, created in Fusion 360. The original antenna of the uConsole CM4 often experiences weak WLAN connections. To address this, I have designed a new cover that accommodates a larger antenna, improving the WLAN reception significantly. Additionally, the cover features a stylish "uConsole CM4" engraving, adding a personalized touch to the device.

## Features
- **Improved WLAN Reception**: The new cover design allows for the use of a larger antenna, enhancing the WLAN signal strength and stability.
- **Custom Engraving**: The cover includes a "uConsole CM4" engraving, giving your device a unique and customized appearance.
- **Easy to Install**: The cover and button insert can be easily printed and attached to the designated area on the uConsole CM4 using thin double-sided adhesive tape. This method ensures a secure and straightforward installation without the need for complex tools or procedures.

## Installation Guide
1. **3D Printing**: Print the cover and button insert using the provided 3D design files.
2. **Prepare the Surface**: Clean the surface on the uConsole CM4 where the cover will be attached to ensure it is free of dust and grease.
3. **Attach with Adhesive Tape**: Apply thin double-sided adhesive tape to the back of the printed cover and button insert.
4. **Position and Secure**: Carefully align the cover and button insert to the designated area on the uConsole CM4 and press firmly to secure them in place.
