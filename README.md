# uConsole-CM4-Custom-Projects-Repository
This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of my personal scripts, configurations, and CAD designs, primarily focused on the uConsole CM4 and related projects. It provides a variety of resources for developers and hobbyists working with the uConsole CM4, a versatile and compact computer based on the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4.
